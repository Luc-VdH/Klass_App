# Klass_App
A simple WebApp that allows users to join groups for secret santa / white elephant parties.

This is a project that is being done to experience the full stack development process. The WebApp therefore includes a backend server running flask to provide enpoints to a frontend website built using React and MUI components. The backend will also make use of a PostgreSQL database.
